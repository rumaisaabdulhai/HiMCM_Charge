## Overview

This repository contains code for the 2019 High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling (HiMCM) in November, a 36 hour math modeling competition. 
Our team 9539 was one of the finalists in the competition. We were given two problems and had to choose between one of them. 
The problem our team chose was about the energy consumption of electric cars, smartphones, and laptops over the years and the increase of charging 
stations as we found it was very relevant to today. Follow this [link](http://users.wpi.edu/~rabdulhai/docs/HiMCMDescriptions.pdf) to view the problem 
descriptions. My team used Mathematica to format our graphs and final paper. We mainly used Python and made classes for each function we required.

The competiton required us to submit a 20-page paper with a short summary of our solution to the problem. You can find our paper 
[here](http://users.wpi.edu/~rabdulhai/docs/HiMCMPaper.pdf).
